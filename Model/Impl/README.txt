Final implementation of ML models and scripts for training, validation and inference.

Training and validation:
* Individual models are trained and validated with the `train_experiment.py` script.
* Ensembles are trained and validated with the `ensemble_experiment.py` script.

Inference:
* Inference can be performed for single models with the `inference.py` script.
* Inference can be performed for ensembles with the `inference_ensemble.py` script.
